## Intuition

Brief explanation of the core concept and why it matters for ML interviews.

**Core Challenge**: What fundamental problem does this solve?

**Business Context**: When and why companies use this approach.

## When to Use / When Not to Use

**Use This When:**
- Specific conditions or problem types
- Data characteristics that favor this approach  
- Business constraints that make this optimal

**Avoid When:**
- Alternative approaches are better suited
- Resource or complexity constraints exist
- Regulatory or ethical concerns apply

## Metrics & Evaluation

**Primary Metrics:**
- Key performance indicators for this approach
- How to measure success in offline evaluation

**Business KPIs:**
- Revenue, engagement, or operational metrics
- Long-term impact measurements

**Evaluation Challenges:**
- Common pitfalls in measurement
- Offline vs online evaluation gaps

## Failure Modes

**Data Issues:**
- Quality problems that affect performance
- Distribution shifts or bias concerns

**Model Performance:**
- Common degradation patterns
- Scaling or generalization failures

**System Failures:**
- Infrastructure or serving problems
- Integration or deployment issues

**Business Impact:**
- Unintended consequences or conflicts
- Regulatory or ethical violations
